    Steps
    1.	Create a Git repository to store your work
    2.	Create (provision) a virtual machine (VirtualBox, Vagrant, etc.)
    3.	Research and choose a web server and install it on the virtual machine
    4.	Configure the web server to serve a static website (e.g. some basic HTML)
    5.	Make sure you can access the website in your web browser



Solution:

    1. Repo created called thandomatomela/DevOps-Project-One
    2. Using Terraform I created an AWS Resource (ECS) to deploy virtual server
    3. Inside virtual server i installed nginx using a bash script i appended in the terraform .tf file
    4. I wrote a basic html script stating "DevOps Project One Accomplished Successfully..." to show the webserver is working.
    5. Website accessible from web browser by ensuring that the security group opened ports 80 and 443.
